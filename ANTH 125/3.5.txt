The Origins of Humanity

Hominid Origins
Pliocene-Pleistocene (3.5 - 2 million years ago) in Africa
Two forms of early hominids
	Australopithecus
		Robostus: large vegetarian
		Africanis: smaller omnivore
	Homo Habilis- Handy Man appears 2.3 Million years ago - tool maker
		Earliest tools appear 2.5 Million years ago
Mostly the same from the neck down compared to a modern human.  Head is very different
Very few sites exist:
	East Africa
	- Olduvai Gorge: deep deposits in a canyon
	- Koobi Fora: eroded deposits on the surface
	Southern Africa
	- Swartskrans: cave
Humans as Primates
	Five fingered grasping hand
	Color vision
	3 dimensional vision
	Bipedalism
	Brain-Culture complex:
		Tools - essential to survival
		Society - division of labor
		Language
	Lack of estrus in Females
	Nakedness - no fur
	Shift from forest to Savannah is important but is not adequate as an explanation
	Other primates live in the Savannah, such as Baboons

Man the Hunter
	Among primates only humans hunt animals larger than themselves
	We have bones of large game animals associated with tools of Homo Habilis at Olduvai & Swartskrans suggesting they hunted the big animals too
	Bipedalism:
		Walk down game
		Display
		Free hands for tools
	Brain-Culture Complex:
		Tools: need tools as defense from predators and to bring down large game
		Society: male bonding, cooperation in hunting
		Language: coordinate hunting, pass on knowledge between generations
	Women are at a disadvantage in hunting
		Smaller body size
		Pregnancy
		Care of babies
	Lack of estrus:
		Women become sexually responsive year round to bind men to them.  Leads to traditional gender roles.
	Nakedness:
		Pair bonding makes sex very important
		Nakedness accentuates sexual characteristics
			Hair placement
			Large breasts
			Large penis
			Exaggeration of sexual characteristics compared to other primates
Woman the Gatherer
	Gathering & Sharing & Unique human characteristics
	Nancy Tanner & Adrienne Zihlman
	Based on Ju'hosani research
	Emphasizes importance of vegetal foods gathered by women
	Bipedalism:
		Women traveled to gather food
		Importance of distance walking
		Bipedalism frees hands to carry children and food
	Brain-Culture complex:
		Tools: increase food gathering and processing
		Society: result of women sharing food
		Language: need for social communication
	Lack of estrus in females:
		By product of bipedalism
		Lack of estrus means women can say no
		Women select social, food sharing males
	Nakedness:
		Importance of sex
	Caring and sharing theory makes the driving force of human evolution the nurturing and sharing of women rather than the aggressive male hunter
	Aggressive nature of men and war must have come along later

The Importance of Grandma
	No other mammals have menopause
	Grandmothers important because they can aid in child care freeing parents to Hunt and Gather
	Grandmas socialize children

Paleoanthropology
	Not a lot of data
	Emphasis on discovery
	Very popular
	Egos

Problems
	Early hominids not apes or Ju'hoansi
	Earliest good evidence for home bases is less than 1 Million years ago
	New evidence suggests multiple species
	Despite problems these theories are very important

Reintroduction of Man the Hunter Theory in Anthropology
	Focus on anatomical changes:
		Bipedal walking
		Nakedness - cooling
		Throwing - chimps bad
		Mind, brain, creativity
	Evidence for Hunting:
		Reinterpret Olduvai
		New site in Kenya
	Same projection of gender roles and division of labor

Outdated Debate in Anthropology
	Begins with assertion that our evolution determines what we are today
	Flawed functionalist logic
	Biological determinism
	Under-estimates human adaptability and role of culture
	Becomes a way to rationalize and support modern prejudices
	Projections of current mentalities on past
