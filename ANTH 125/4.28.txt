Identity and the Past
    From work of Susan Kus and Susan Pollock Mythic History
    Little of no separation of past and present.
    Ascending anachronism - and event or institution is pushed further back in time.
    Descending Anachronism is where an event or institution is brought forward in time
    Role of archeology
        Recognize the fluidity of identity
        Identify and Question interests of groups creating identities
        Be critical of the use of archaeological knowledge in these creations
