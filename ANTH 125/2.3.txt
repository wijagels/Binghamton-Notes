In reality, king tut wasn't very important at all.
Came to throne at age of 9, died as a teenager.  Entire time someone else was ruling on his behalf.

Egypt:
	Very long history (3,000 years)
	Tutankhamen ruled during the new kingdom
	Tut lived 1,000 years after the pyramids were built
	Common themes in Egyptian history
		Religion
		Resurrection of the dead
		Mummies
			Body must be preserved or else your soul will die
			Mummification happens because of dryness
			Get rid of all the eternal organs, and stuck into jars
			Heart left in so that the gods can check it
			Soak in salt water, and then it dries out
			Covered in oils and resins (actually bad for it)
			Wrap body up in linen and throw some jewels in there
	So many mummies around, linen was being taken to make paper
	You get a mummy, you get a mummy, everybody gets a mummy!
	Great pyramids robbed
	New kingdom pharaohs built tombs in the valley of kings to avoid looters
		Dug into rock of the valley and tombs created in artificial caves
		Easier to seal, and people lived there so the tombs could be guarded
	European Archaeologists in late 19th century
		Search for an unlooted tomb
		England and France looting Egypt
		By 1900 little hope of finding a tomb
		Howard Carter - working class, poor
			Not very well liked
			Considered an asshole
			Popular among the workmen
			Caught looters raiding a mummy shaft
		Lord Carnarvon - Carter's sponsor
			Playboy, wild youth
			Went to Egypt for the dry climate
			Meets Carter and is convinced by Carter that Carter might find a tomb
			He funds Carter
		Last year of funding, Carter finds stairs
			Oh shit, is it an un-looted tomb?
		Carter's search was not a matter of luck
			He figured out which kings were not found: Akhenaten and Tutankhamen
			The Great Heresy
				Pharaohs tried to change the religion in Egypt, so everywhere their names come up, they're destroyed
			He worked through the list of kings and filled in the missing parts
			Hypothesis: Tut was a New Kingdom Pharaoh thus he must be in the valley of kings
			Did tons of research and identified Tut's funeral party trash that was originally thought to be his actual tomb
			Gridded valley and figured out what part not excavated, and dug in this area
			2.5 acre area searched for 7 years
			Finds the place, and it turns out it had been resealed twice
		The excavation
			Takes 10 years to excavate the inside
			Staged publicity
			Lots of famous visitors
			Lots of controversy
			Carter dug very carefully and carefully documented every item
			Great news stories
