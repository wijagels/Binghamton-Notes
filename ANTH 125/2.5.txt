	Difficult to get in and out of
	Have to go outside to grow food
	Good:
	Preservation
		Less maintenance required to keep buildings from falling apart
	Passive solar heating and cooling
		When sun is high in the summer, it's shady and cooler
		In the winter months, it gets more light, making it warmer
	Defense
		Very hard for enemies to get in, lots of choke points
