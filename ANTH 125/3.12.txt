The Peopling of the Western Hemisphere

No evidence that humans evolved in the Americas
No hominid fossils found
New world monkeys are primitive
No good dates before 30,000 years ago
Fanciful theories
	Pre-Adamitic race, not humans
	Native Americans as lost tribes
	Mound Builder Myth
Modern theories of Pre-Columbian contact
	Concern landings by seafarers
		Lost God theme in European literature
	Dubious Possibilities
	Chinese anchor stones, San Diego
	Celts, Mystery Hill, MA
	Sod House, L'anse aux Meadows
	Norse: Labrador AD 1000-1200
	Norse people from Greenland showed up
	Norse people had no impact on the native american cultures
Bering Land Bridge - Beringia
	Wide corridor: 200 to 1300 miles wide
	NW Alaska was not iced over
	Not a purposeful migration, the people didn't actually know they were going over a bridge
Controversial dating of the migration
	Very clear before 11,000 years ago
	Probably 20,000 to 30,000 years ago
Radical Revision of Theory
	Kenniwick man found in Washington
		9,000+ years ago
		Initially misidentified as a Caucascoid
		Conflict with Native Americans
	Entry by boats is likely
		Coast is submerged
		Some isolated finds along the coast
	15,000 years in Beringia
		Genetic analysis
			Asian haplogroups
			Mutations
		Linguistic analysis
			Asian languages
			Changes
			Lost mother tongue
	Entry from Europe is not likely
		Haplogroup X = Asian
		Dating off - 5,000 year gap
		No evidence of Solutrian in Northern Europe
Native Americans Reject Archaeological Theory
	Each Nation has its own history
	Nation created in sacred land
	These stories establish the identity of the people and their relationship to each other, other peoples, and nature
	Reconciling Arch and Native American stories?
