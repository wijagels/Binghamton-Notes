The Beginnings of Agriculture
	10,000 Years ago

Agricultural Revolution

Revolutionary because
	- Agriculture was a very late development in the grand scheme of human history
	- Appears in many places at end of Pleistocene (Ice age)
Not Revolutionary because
	- Appearance of Agriculture was not sudden
	- Agriculture has various degrees of intensity
	- Agriculture originated more than once
	- Not universal eg. Australia
Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age)
	Foundations of agriculture
	As early as 20,000 years ago in Near East Mesolithic:
		A generalized adaptation - seeds
		Development of microlithic and grinding tools
	In Western Hemisphere called the Archaic period

Centers for origin of Agriculture, not a universal transformation
	Near East (Barley, Wheat) 10,000 years ago
	China (Millet) 8,000 years ago
	Southeast Asia (Rice) 8,000 years ago
	Africa (Millet & Sorghum) 4,000 years ago
	Mesoamerica (Corn, Beans, and Squash) 9,000 to 4,000 years ago
	Andes, South America (Potatoes, Beans, and Qinoa) 7,000 years ago
	Eastern United States (Sunflower, Squash) 4,800 years ago

Hunter Gatherers
	Hunters and gatherers have art, dance, mythology
	Do not work that hard
	Diet varied with some meat
	High infant mortality but long life
	Little social control
	
Changes Brought by Agriculture
	Must work hard, up to 18 hours a day
	Bad diet, little meat, high carbohydrates
	Health often not good, dental problems
	Lower life expectancy
	Epidemic disease
		Disease that comes from domesticated animals appears
	There are pros...
	Lower infant mortality
	Increased production leads to population growth
	Control of resources, don't depend on ecology as much.  Can produce more food by investing more labor.
	Sedentism
	Elite can extract surplus
	Land as a controllable resource
	Most of the worlds population since the beginnings of agriculture and today lives under such conditions

Origins of Agriculture in the Near East
	2 major grasses: Barley and Wheat
	Biological changes to make for a good crop:
		Eliminate the Brittle Rachis
		Non-Chaffy Husk
		Hard Husked Seeds
	Oasis theory
		Desiccation at end of Ice age drives people, plants, and animals into Oasis
		With greater familiarity Eureka!
		Problem is that we know there was not massive environmental change
	Hilly Flanks Theory
		Jarmo (8750 BP) village of 150 population
		Hilly flanks of fertile crescent where wild forms of plants and animals are
		Mesolithic hunters settled in
		Eureka!
	Marginal Environment Theory
		Eureka is bullshit
		Wild stands of grains highly productive, no need for agriculture
		Agriculture resulted when population growth forced people into marginal environments
	Climatic Shift Theory
		In the Levant - Mesolithic peoples lived in sedentary villages and gathered wild grain
		Climactic change decreases wild resources and the population grew
		People rapidly shifted to agriculture

Agriculture in the Americas
	Corn:
		Most domesticated of plants
		Cannot reproduce without human aid
		Genetically very plastic
		Can be grown all the way from tropics to Binghamton, NY
	Beans:
		Complement corn
	Squash:
		Anti-flatulence
		Lots of vitamins
Animal Domestication:
	Dog in Mesolithic 15,000 years ago
	Cat Neolithic 9,500 years ago
	Old theory, animals first
	In Near East follows plant domestication by 1,000 years
	In New Guinea, agriculture started to feed pigs 7,000 years ago
	Africa and South Asia animal first
	Domesticated animals smaller and more docile
	Increased milk production
	Wooly hair on sheep
	Change in cross-section of goat horns
	Bizarre forms
	Domestication later in the Americas
		Fewer Animals domesticated
			- Turkey
			- Llama and Alpaca
			- Guinea Pig
		No beasts of burden
		Epidemic diseases don't show up until Columbian times
