Data Recovery: Survey & Excavation

Research Design:
	Precedes any data recovery: survey or excavation
	Research design is a plan for doing research
	Example of carter's search for King Tut's Tomb
	Always include a discussion of sampling
Archaeologists always sample
	Can't dig every site or all portions of all sites
	Can't collect all the data when dug
	Sites do not contain all of past material culture

Sampling
	Population is the whole set of materials you wish to study
	Sample is a subset of the population
	Sample unit is each member of the population
	Judgmental is based on judgment or prior knowledge
		Bias is the prior knowledge
	Systematic uses a patterned method for choosing sample units
		Bias is the pattern or system
	Random is where each unit has an equal chance of being in the sample
		No bias
	Haphazard is no formal method to select the sample units
		Bias is unknown

Verde Terrace site in Central Arizona
	Hohokam Site, AD 900-1100
	Judgmental sample of pits to find depth
	Systematic sample of trenches to identify pithouses, found 15
	Random numbers table used to select pithouses for excavation, dug 9

We use samples to make estimates about the population
	Accuracy - do the estimates reflect the population
	Precision - how exactly do the estimates reflect the population

Survey
	Locating and describing the archaeological record from surface indications
	Sites are often buried
	Use exposures -- animals, and hills
	Shovel test pits
	Crop marks
		Better growth in places where pits of soil are
	Remote sensing

Survey - GIS
	GIS Links Maps and Data
		Used in many fields
		Look for patterns in spatial distributions
		Least-cost effort analysis
		Viewshed
			See if the view from somewhere is nice

Cerros de Trincheras
	Sonoran Desert
	Terraces, walls and structures
	Why build on a hill?
		Defense
		Environment
		Monumentality
	Used GIS
		Least cost and viewshed
	Defense should limit least cost paths
	Defense should limit viewshed
	What was being defended?

Excavation
	Excavation is a series of compromises
	Nature of site
	Research question
	Time and Money
	What will happen to the site later
	Vertical control site datum
	Horizontal control site grid
	Clearing excavations
	Penetrating excavations
Verde view sites in Central AZ
	Contract excavation
	Interstate bridge
	1st excavation Randall did
	To do an excavation you need
		A Crew
		Equipment
		A place to live
		Crappy field showers
	Excavation process
		Establish datum and horizontal grid
		Systematic test pits
		Find pithouse
