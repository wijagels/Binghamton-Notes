Cannibalism & Ancestral Pueblo History

Cannibalism is a highly charged concept 
Great popular fascination with cannibalism

People are very uncomfortable with cannibalism
Source of humor and jokes
Cannibalism and colonialism
How the West defines the other cultures
Cannibals are less than human
Cannibalism associated with tools of oppression

Word originates with Columbus

    Spanish Crown only allowed enslavement of Cannibals

Cannibalism: The Debate
    Different kinds of cannibalism:
        Ritual
        Criminal
        Survival - universal
        Dietary
    Dietary cannibalism as meta-myth?
    Arens - The Man Eating Myth
        No good evidence for dietary cannibalism
        No first hand accounts
        We were cannibals
        Those people over there are cannibals
    Findings contested and subject to debate
    It's usually just imposed upon cultures instead of based on real evidence

Ancestral Pueblo Cannibalism?
    Christy Turner - Man Corn
    Myth of Peaceful Pueblos
        Argued that lots of violence went on
    Six criteria for Cannibalism
        Fractures
        Cut marks from muscle being cut off bone
        Bones burned on end but not in middle
    Pueblos offended - big debate
    Anasazi = Ancestral Pueblo
    Four corners region
    Corn, Beans, and Squash
    History - Colorado Plateau
        Pithouses to Pueblos (AD 300 to 900)
        Chaco Canyon (AD 900 to 1150)
            Impressive development
            Great Houses
            Roads
            Outliers
            Unique in Pueblo History
        Great Pueblo (AD 1150 to 1300)
            Large towns
            Cliff dwellings
            Violence
        Rio Grande Pueblos (AD 1300 to 1540)
    Turner:
        Over 38 cases of cannibalism
        Concentrated in Chaco Canyon area and time
        Built by Toltec Thugs from Mexico
        Reign of terror

    Problems:
        Other explorations - 6 criteria circular logic
        1,000s of burials lack criteria
        Witchcraft killings
        Mortuary Ritual
        Violent deaths
        Post depositional damage
        Animal gnawing
        Cases for cannibalism do not cluster in Chaco by time or space
        Most evidence from PIII four-corners region
        Idea of Toltec Thugs not supportable
            Tula too early
            Toltec myth
        Turner exaggerates number of cases
    Actual Cannibalism?
        Mancos Canyon - 5Mtumr-2346
            Mid-Twelfth Century
            Tim White
            29 individuals including men, women, and children
        Cowboy Wash
            Colorado site AD 1150-1200
            Burned village
            35 bodies unburied
            Coprolite (shit) with human protein in the most sacred part of the village
            Cannibalism evidence from the shit
        Forces new settlements to be very defensible
    Clear evidence for eating of human flesh
        How common?
        Donner Party
        Cannibals vs Noble Savages
        Sensationalism
            Boston Public
            King of the Hill
            X-Files Chaco Chicken
    Can we talk about cannibalism?
        Need balanced view
            People are not cannibals by default
            People aren't inherently violent or peaceful
        Under what conditions do these things happen?
            Happened a lot among shipwrecked people
            Maritime laws for cannibalism
            Happens when extreme violence is already going on
            Need to take context into account
