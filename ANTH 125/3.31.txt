    19th century evolutionists
        Accepted common usage
        Pinnacle of evolution
    Neo-Evolutionists
        Reject ethnocentrism
        Short hand for urbanized state level societies
        Would like to drop concept entirely, but it's too ingrained in the popular imagination
        The state is their real interest
        State societies have a centralized political organization, class stratifiction, and the elite use coercive force to maintain their position
        V. Gordon Childe
            Cultural evolution = a series of revolutions
