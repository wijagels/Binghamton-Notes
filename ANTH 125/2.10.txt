Controlling time and space

Patterning
	Key to archaeological interpretation
	Patterning is a regular relationship between material objects and space
	Usually products of nature are not patterned, whereas products of human action are
	Artifacts are portable objects modified by human action
	Features are non-portable human made remains
	Ecofacts are natural remains that have cultural significance
	Sites are locations of human activity, a spatial cluster of artifacts, features, and ecofacts
	Human actions are patterned.  Dialectical relationship between human action and material patterns
		The room is shaped by people, and the way you use the room is affected by the patterns in the room.  Example: lecture hall
	Human action creates patterns even as the patterning of material things structures human action

Use Wear
	The use of artifacts and features to perform tasks usually leaves faint patterns of wear that can be used to infer the task they were used for.

Time & Space
	In a site:
		Space is the 2 dimensional plane
		Time is vertical patterning
	Generally Archaeologists wish to control time so that they can look at human action in a given space
	Settlement pattern analysis can be done at three levels
		Activity Area
			Place where humans did something
		Community
			Many activity areas, example is the Binghamton campus
		Region
			Several communities in the same geographic area
	Settlement pattern analysis
		Paleo-Indian site where 190 Bison were killed in a drive ~8,000 BC
			Age and sex composition of herd indicated that the kill occurred in the summer
			Patterning of bone in piles indicated animals were differently butchered
			Total meat: 60,000 lbs.  150 people involved
		Classic period Maya burials CE 300-850
			Ranked burial goods by value
			Grouped burials by period (early and late) and by location (ceremonial centers vs house mounds)
				Early - few goods with women and children, rich male burials in house mounds
				Late - all rich burials in centers, all poor burials in house mounds
			Achieved status changes to ascribed status
				Noble families who live in the centers instead of returning to house mounds

	Dating, Two Types:
		Chronometric / Absolute dating.  Dates events to a modern calendar
			Carbon 14 dating
				All living organisms contain carbon
				2 forms of carbon, C12 and C14 (radioactive)
				Ratio of C12 to C14 allows a calculation of the date
				Can be used everywhere.  Method is good to 100,000 years ago
			Dendro-Chronology (tree ring dating)
				Trees add a ring each year
				Stress (drought, cold) causes ring width to vary
				Date is inferred from variations in ring width
				Technique used in Southwest/Northwest, with limited use in N Eur. and NE US.  Good to 1,500 years ago
		Relative dating.  Dates events relative to each other
			Form or stylistic seriation
				Styles change over time
			Frequency seriation
				Battleship graphs
