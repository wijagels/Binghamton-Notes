The Past is Made in the Present
The Past Legitimates the Present
Archaeologists are Part of this Process
Made does not Mean Made Up

Origins of archeology from nationalist movements
	Nation States
	Nation is the people who share a common culture and language, territory, History and Heritage

Archeology in Nazi Germany
	In National Socialism Race = Nation
	German or Aryan race was #1
	Rise of nation states in Eastern Europe
	Eugenics movement: genetic determinism
	Gustaf Kossinna: linguist turned archaeologist
		Wrote in early 20th century
		Archaeological culture = an assemblage of traits, with a geographic distribution
		Archaeological Culture legitimates a nation
		Works picked up by the Nazis
		Claim to a much larger area as being German
	Legitimated the notion of an Aryan race
	Legitimated the invasion of Eastern Europe
	Propaganda tool
	Nazi archeology teams follow invasions
	Opportunity to advance prehistory
	Types of archaeologists in Nazi Germany
		Party liners - consciously helped
		Mitlaufer - passive fellow travelers
		Opposition - few, retired, fired and exiled
		After war - little critique, description

Three basic approaches to Archeology in the world
	1. Nationalist
		Extend history of nation/nation state
		Masada in Israel
			Used as a nationalistic symbol
		Nazis are extreme case
		Most common type in the world
		Important in places were there were former colonies
		Major issue in Europe with collapse of Soviet Union & formation of EU
			Big deal in Yugoslavia
	2. Imperialist
		Rare - British, USSR, France, USA, Japan
		Traditionally based on Colonial domination
		Today
			Universal Theory
			Oppose nationalist archeologies
			Archaeological record belongs to all of humanity
			Used by Britain to keep the Greece from taking back the Parthenon Marbles
	3. Colonialist
		Exists in nations with conquered peoples: USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, much of Latin America, Southern Africa
		People of the past are not of the nation
		Tends to denigrate accomplishments of indigenous people
		The Great Zimbabwe
			Attempts to claim that Black Africa didn't build this
			Helps Zimbabwe nationalism

Indiana Jones is an Imperialist archaeologist.  He goes to foreign countries and steals their shit.

Archeology and the Native Americans
	Heritage is an owned past
	US archeology is a locus of struggle
	Reburial and Repatriation
	Who will write the history of Native American People?
	Descendants of the conquerors study the conquered
	How the hell do you legitimate the stealing of land from the Native Americans?
	Enlightenment Ideals
		Environmental Determinism
			The environment of where you live controls how well you'll do
		Native Americans = Noble Savages
		Blank Slate
		Rejects Nobility and Monarchy
	Tommy J comes out and shows Native Americans made the burial mounds, and that Native Americans aren't savages
	Native Americans are the first Americans
	However, they won't be able to survive civilization, being children of nature
	Native Americans always object to what archaeologists do
	Competing histories
	American Indian Movement - urban
	Traditionalists asserted sovereignty
	Native American Graves and Repatriation Act of 1990
		Act provides for return of bodies and artifacts
		Gives Native Americans a legal voice
		Tribal Archaeology programs
		Who will write Native American Histories?
	Yaqui Repatriation
		Ales Hrdlicka - 1902 Sonora, Mexico
