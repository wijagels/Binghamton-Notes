Pompeii, Herculaneum and the history of archeology

Herculaneum is frozen in time by the volcano.  Better preserved than Pompeii
Great opportunity for archaeologists to build an idea of what it was like

Herculaneum discovered 1709
Pompeii discovered 1748
Both sites mined for statuary
Awakened interest in the ancient past

Archeology is a unique product of Western Civilization
Need to have:
	1. Appreciation of the past
	2. Past = long time with changes
	3. Dig to learn about the past
