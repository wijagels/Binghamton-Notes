Conservation Archeology
-- Last lecture on exam--

Archaeological sites are a non-renewable resource
	Last 20 years very heavy destruction
	Rate of destruction is increasing
Why we need to conserve
	We do not have a good sample of sites
	New techniques recover new types of data
	New questions require new data
4 Major factors account for destruction
	1. Looting or pothunting
		Destroys patterning and context
		Destroys many types of data
		Looting is big business
		Art museums frequently encourage it
		UNESCO Convention of 1970
			Prohibits exchange of looted antiquities
	2. Economic development
		Activities that disturb the ground surface will disturb sites
		Most countries have laws and programs to protect sites from economic development
	3. Excavation
		Important to not excavate all sites:
			New techniques and questions arise
		Focus work on threatened sites
	4. War
		A sporadic but profound impact on sites
		Sites are destroyed in battles
		Increased looting of sites and collections
		Destruction of Museums
		Death of archaeologists
Archeology and the Law
	In most of Europe and the rest of the world sites are property of the state
	In the US due to the primacy of private property sites are property of the land owner
	US federal laws only apply to cases involving Lands, Permits, and Monies
	State, County and Municipal ordinances exist but vary widely
	Antiquities act of 1906
		1. Permit needed to dig on federal land
		2. Misdemeanor fine for digging without a permit
		3. President may set aside federal land as National Monuments
		Amended in 1979 to be a felony
	National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
	National Environmental policy Act of 1969
		Archeology part of planning process
		Must asses extent of archaeological record
		Must asses impacts of project on record
		Must develop a plan for mitigation
	Most archaeologists in US work in Cultural Resource Management
	Field Techs - aka Shovel Bums
