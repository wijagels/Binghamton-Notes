Royal Burials
    Fascinate archaeologists and the public
    They contain the most beautiful objects of antiquity
    They are the most visible and lasting monuments of antiquity
    They are personal- linked to the life of an individual
The Paradox
    They are blatant examples of human exploitation and suffering
        In some cases people died in funeral rites
        Thousands toiled to build and stock the tombs
        For every king, thousands lived a mean existence of hard work
    They are the source of some of the most beautiful art in human history
        Most of ancient art in museums come from royal tombs
        This art is an expression of our humanity
        Each item links us in a tangible physical way with the aesthetics of the past
    Massive royal tombs do not occur at the peak or end of civilizations but at their beginning
        2 examples:
            The death pits of Ur
                Excavated 1922-1934 by Leonard Woolley
                Sumer is southernmost Mesopotamia
                14 warring city states
                Ur covers 148 acres
                Population of 10,000 to 20,000
                Theocratic state based on irrigation agriculture
                Found cemetery with 2,000 graves
                Common graves and royal tombs 2,500 BC
                Only two royal graves not robbed
                    A-bar-ji
                    Pu-Abi nim
                Great wealth found and hundreds of human sacrifices.
                Later royal tombs less elaborate
                Ur established Sumer state 200 years later
            The tomb of Chin Shih Huang Ti
                First Emperor of China, died in 221 BC
                United China through war and treachery
                Standardized money, finished great wall
                Shifted populations, strict legal code
                Feared assassination
                After his death the empire fell apart
                Tomb took 36 years to construct
                Massive earthen mound with tomb within
                Surrounded by a walled ceremonial city
                Army of ceramic figurines (6,000 in 1 pit)
                Many different pits
                    Bronze Chariots
                    Acrobats
                    Rare Birds and Animals
                    Stone Armour
                    Civil Officials
                Communist Chinese and the paradox of royal burials
                    Aware of the paradox
Immortality and the State
    Why this massive investment?
    Why at the beginning?
    We must consider specific context
    Ideology is the beliefs used to legitimate power
    All precede or follow establishment of institutionalized authority = states
    Charismatic leaders
    Ideology links them to supernatural
    In a state immortality in the position not the person
