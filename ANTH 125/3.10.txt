Paleolithic
Stone Age is divided into 3 parts:
	Lower - 2 million years ago - 250,000 years ago
	Middle - 250,000 years ago - 40,000 years ago
	Upper - 40,000 years ago - 10,000 years ago
	Arctic environment
Homo Erectus
	Peking Man, Java Man, Sinjanthropis
	Earliest forms 2+ million years ago
	Earliest Hominid outside of Africa
		Israel 1.5 mya
		Georgia 1.75 mya
		Java 1.8 mya
		China 1.1 mya
		Europe 1 mya
	Most differences between modern humans found in the head
	Most likely to be preserved in a cave, hence the name cavemen
	First Hominid in a temperate climate
		- Fire
		- Shelters - Terra Amata, France 300,000 mya
		- Big game hunting, no projectiles tough
	Acheulian tool assemblage - hand ax

Neanderthal
	Only found in Europe and Near East
	Stereotype - stooped shouldered, bowed knees
	1st specimen was an arthritic old man
	Most differences from modern humans are in the cranium again
		Larger skull brow ridges
		Occipital Bun
	Possibly an adaptation to a cold climate
	How different from modern human language
	Mousterian Technology
		- Possibly projectile points
		- Levallois cores and flakes
	Cultural Development
		- Care of old and crippled
		- Formal burial of dead: red ocher, flowers
		- Shamanism - cave bear cult?
	Lewis Binford - Francois Bordes debate
		- 4 assemblages of tools
		- Bordes - 4 tribes
		- Binford - 4 different adaptations to particular environments as the ice sheets grow and recede
		Turns out Bordes was wrong, there were more than 4.
	Transition from Neanderthals to Modern Humans
		- Homo Sapiens Sapiens in NE by 90,000 years ago
		- Modern humans in Europe by 40,000 years ago
		- Vidija cave, Croatia 28,000 years ago
		- Modern human child Portugal 24,500 years ago
		- DNA evidence suggests a relation, we have genome from 1 individual

Modern Humans
	Earliest forms in Africa 200,000 years ago
	Cro-Magnon in Europe by 40,000 years ago
	Sites known from steppes of Russia to Spain
	Hobbits? Or down's syndrome.  On some island in Indonesia
	Proliferation of technology:
		Finely made bifacial projectile points
		Bone and antler tools
		Atl Atl - projectile launcher
		Needles, buttons, tailored clothing
		Highly specialized gadget technology
		Great deal of regional diversity
	Only finding evidence of tools from Europe, probably because Europeans don't give a shit about other countries
	Paleolithic art:
		10,000 to 20,000 years ago
		Cave paintings
		Over 200 caves are known

		Is it art?  How photos misrepresent it
		- Caves are not Art Galleries
		- Framing, pictures are taken at a certain angle
		- Use of cave surface, bulges
		- Complex overlapping panels
		- Carving

		Ritual Hunting magic
		Leroi-Gourhan structuralism
		Problems:
			May not just be in caves, caves are the place where they actually are preserved
			Many portable items found primarily in Eastern Europe
			Made for at least 10,000 years
			European Bias:
				Vast majority of the research is done in Europe
				Cro-Magnon - French Nationalism
				Origin of Art
				Projects Europe into Paleolithic novels
					- Clan of the Cave Bear
					- The Inheritors - inverts tale
